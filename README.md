<h3 style="letter-spacing: 3px;">PURPOSE</h3>

<hr />

For an apartment complex that has parking lots intended for residents, mixups can happen when dealing with who can park where. There is a need to distinguish between tenant vehicles and visitors and this particular system utilizes differentiation by permit stickers displayed on windshields. Each sticker has a numerical identifier attached to it, which can then be used to indicate its owner through a database. This is that database.

Tenants interested in registering for a resident vehicle permit, are given vehicle permit registrations that carry a unique number, marked specifically for identification.

This application was developed with the intention to create an interface for record keeping that is simplified, organized, and easily accesible.

Using React, a JavaScript library, this project enables a user to create database entries reflecting apartment complex tenant information and their registered vehicles. User can create vehicle permit registrations and associate them with apartments. View a single apartment to see all registered permits that are associated on file, as each apartment can have up to 3 registrations; 1 registration per lease-holder.

Create records of tenants and their associated vehicles with a given permit registration sticker.
